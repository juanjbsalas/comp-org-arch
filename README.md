#COSC273 Computer Organization and Architecture Assignments

This repository contains programming assignments completed for my Computer Organization and Architecture course. The programs are written in Assembly language and demonstrate key concepts such as user input handling, string manipulation, data structures, and arithmetic operations.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific assignment:

### `Assignment2/`
A program that prompts the user for various inputs, performs calculations based on those inputs, and generates a unique username using the input data.

### `Assignment3/`
A program that:
- Accepts a word and a number `X` from the user, then prints the word `X` times.
- Then requests three space-separated integers, and outputs both the original and sorted list of those numbers.

### `Assignment4/`
*To be updated soon.*

### `Assignment5/`
A program that uses structures to store and process information for two students. It calculates:
- Total and current credit hours
- GPA
- Additional metrics derived from the student data

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Will be updated soon
